# yellow_flag (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Yellow Flag is a hobby game project. The idea is to make a F1 game where you are the race director.

The current version features no gameplay, but I am able to create the map and tracks fast as they are built with hexagon tiles like a puzzle game (shown in figure 2). Each tile contains some data, which for example helps when creating racing lines for the F1 cars to follow (shown in figure 3)
